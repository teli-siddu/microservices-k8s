# Design Decisions

## Key Decisions

- **CQRS Pattern**: Implemented to separate read and write concerns.
- **DTOs**: Used for data transfer between layers to decouple the application logic from the data access layer.
- **Microservices**: Adopted for scalability and separation of concerns.

## Rationale

Each design decision was made to enhance maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of the application.

## Future Considerations

- Evaluate the need for additional patterns or changes as the application evolves.
